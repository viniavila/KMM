# **Kindle Manga Maker** #

I've created this small application as a private project because I love mangas (Japanese Comics), Kindle and Linux. Since I bought a Kindle Paperwhite 2nd, I'm used to reading many books, both bought from Amazon Store and some free books. And also I have discovered that it's very good to read mangas in Kindle as well.

For around three years I was a little far from Linux community because I own a Macbook Air and using its trackpad in Linux was terrible because the lack of gesture support (and OSX was enough for me). But since mtrack drives were improved, and some gestures now is supported I came back to our freedom and I released myself from Apple's claws. Now I'm running Archlinux, my favorite distro (Keep It Simple Stupid!).

Back when I used OSX, I used to create my *.mobi manga files using the tool Kindle Comic Creator (KCC), that is provided by Amazon itself both for OSX and Windows. But with no support to Linux what is pretty strange, because I'm not sure but I think they use Qt as UI Framework so, compiling it for Linux would be "piece of cake". But for whatever reason Amazon did not this. Only the command line tool "kindlegen" is available for Linux.

That was MY reason to create this program. I want a KCC replacement that runs natively in Linux (no wine stuff), that is easy to use and lightweight (simple is better). It still requires kindlegen to compile the project files to MOBI format. Afterwards, you can transfer the file to the documents folder inside Kindle via USB or using Calibre or other tool. Or you can send the file to your Amazon email (**something_XX@kindle.com**) that you chan check accessing *Menu > Settings > Device Options > Customize your Kindle > Kindle email address*. This document will be available for download in your device.

This program is designed to make documents compatible with **Kindle Paperwhite 2nd Gen**. You can try to test if other devices will read correctly the documents generated by this program. I cannot do this tests so your help will be pretty appreciated.
